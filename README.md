# Breakable-Toy: FreelAnswers
## (working on errors)

Trello: https://trello.com/b/phvPp362/breakable-toy

## What is it?
freeLanswers gives users the opportunity to get questions answered live, in real time chat, in a topic of their choice, and by an expert in that field. How does it do this? Well, freeLanswers takes the idea of using endorsements, similar to those you see on linkedin, to give skilled users an incentive to answer questions that are being asked in a particular field. Satisfy a user with the answer they were looking for, and they can endorse you for that skill, only to benefit you by adding more experience to your resume through endorsements.

As a user with a question, you may type your question into the field, add your description, and tag the skills required to answer the question. The search function will find users, who are currently online, who are experienced in those tagged skills, and let them know that there is somebody who needs their help. Wait a few moments and you may see a chat box pop up with a person who can walk you through the problem step by step. If you are satisfied with the answer you received, let the world know by endorsing them for their knowledge!

## Why did I create it?
I believe there is a giant wealth of knowledge around us that is not being accessed to at its fullest potential. Without having to keep refreshing the page, wiating around for posts from inexperienced users, freeLancers gives one person the opportunity to build their resume while giving another person a means of getting a question answered immediately.
